# IHMC Logger Docker

Dockerfile repository for running the IHMC Logger distribution as a Docker container.

## Cameras vs. No Cameras

The IHMC Logger software can be synced up with video data. Currently, the docker distribution only supports a no-camera configuration. Adding camera support to the docker container is on the roadmap.

## Rebuilding the container

### Using the latest release of the Logger software

The container can be rebuilt with a simple `docker build -t <your image name here> .`. This will download the latest release of the Logger from [Our Bintray](https://bintray.com/ihmcrobotics/distributions/IHMCLogger/view) at build time.

### Using locally built versions of the Logger

If you want to clone this repo and build your own container from the Dockerfile and the Logger from source, then it currently requires you to clone https://github.com/ihmcrobotics/ihmc-open-robotics-software and build the Logger distribution included with the RobotDataCommunication project. You will want to use the `-LOCAL` Dockerfile as well.

Clone the project, navigate to the `RobotDataCommunication` directory, and then run

    gradle loggerDistTar

This will output the tarball to `RobotDataCommunication/build/distributions`. Move the tarball to the same directory as the Dockerfile then run the build.

    docker build -t ihmc-logger-no-cameras-local -f Dockerfile-LOCAL .

You will want to make sure that the `LOGGER_VERSION` Environment Variable in the Dockerfile is the same as the version number on the tarball generated by the Gradle build. By default, this version number is inherited from the overarching version number assigned to all subprojects of IHMCOpenRoboticsSoftware.
